README - Readiness 4.0 Web Application
======================================

Purpose:
--------
The Readiness 4.0 web application is designed to analyze diagnostic data uploaded by customers to determine if their RabbitMQ cluster can be migrated to RabbitMQ 4.0. The tool runs fully on the client side within a web browser, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure and private. This application is intended to be integrated into the 7S website (https://seventhstate.io/).

1. source/
----------
This folder contains the core source files of the web application.
- `rabbitmq-4.0-checker.html`:
This is the main HTML file that provides the user interface for the application. It includes input fields for the number of nodes, Erlang version selection, file upload, and a section to display the analysis results.
- `rabbitmq-analysis.js`:
This JavaScript file contains the logic for validating inputs, reading and analyzing the uploaded RabbitMQ definition file, and displaying the results to the user.

2. tests/
---------
This folder is intended for test files and scripts. These tests ensure the application works correctly and reliably. It includes unit tests, possibly end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions.
To run test, please reead the note on tests/README

3. image/
---------
This folder contains image files used in the web application.

Usage:
------
1. Open the `rabbitmq-4.0-checker.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the number of nodes in your RabbitMQ cluster.
3. Select the Erlang version from the dropdown menu.
4. Upload your RabbitMQ definition file in JSON format.
5. Click the "Check Readiness" button to determine if your RabbitMQ cluster is ready for migration to RabbitMQ 4.0.
6. Review the results displayed on the web page to understand any necessary actions to prepare for the migration.

Dependencies:
-------------
- A web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- The application runs entirely on the client side and does not require any server-side components.

Security and Privacy:
---------------------
The Readiness 4.0 web application ensures that all data processing occurs on the client side, meaning no sensitive data is transmitted to a server. This design prioritizes user privacy and data security.
